    print("1. ✅ Disabled conditional caching in generate() method")
    print("2. ✅ Disabled conditional caching in generate_chunks() method")
    print("3. ✅ Disabled conditional caching in generate_chunks_with_saved_voice() method")

    print("\n🎯 Expected Behavior:")
    print("   - Each chunk prepares conditionals from scratch")
    print("   - No caching or reuse of conditionals")
    print("   - Slower performance (back to original speed)")
    print("   - Voice characteristics should be preserved")
    print("   - No '🎯 Preparing conditionals once' messages in logs")

    print("\n🔍 Next Steps:")
    print("   - Test with a short text (1-2 chunks)")
    print("   - Check if first chunk sounds correct")
    print("   - Look for '🔄 Using original sequential processing' in logs")
    print("   - Compare with previous behavior")
    print("   - If fixed, we can debug the caching logic")
    print("   - If not fixed, issue is in other parts of the system")
    
    print("\n⚠️  Note:")
    print("   - Performance will be slower (no caching benefits)")
    print("   - This is temporary to isolate the issue")
    print("   - Once we confirm the fix, we can re-enable with proper debugging")
    print("   - All conditional caching methods are now disabled")
