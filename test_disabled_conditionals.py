    print("   - No '✅ Conditionals prepared using voice profile' messages during chunks")

    print("   - Look for '🚫 TEMPORARILY DISABLED' messages in logs")
    print("   - Should see conditionals prepared only once at the start")

    print("\n⚠️  Note:")
    print("   - Performance will be slower (no caching benefits)")

    print("   - Once we confirm the fix, we can re-enable with proper debugging")
    print("   - All conditional preparation/caching is now disabled")
